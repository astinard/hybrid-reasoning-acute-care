# Hybrid Reasoning for Acute Care: Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Clinical Constraints

A comprehensive literature review and research foundation for developing hybrid AI systems that combine temporal knowledge graphs, clinical constraints, and generative models for emergency department decision support.

## Project Overview

This repository contains research materials, literature reviews, and foundational work for a novel approach to acute care AI that:

- Represents ED visits as temporal knowledge graphs of clinical events
- Integrates clinical rules and guidelines as reasoning constraints
- Uses generative models for counterfactual trajectory simulation
- Fuses multimodal data (text, images, waveforms, structured data)
- Applies to real-world tasks: ICD coding, documentation, decision support
